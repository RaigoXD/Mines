## INSTALLATION

To start with the installation, you obviously have to clone this project on your computer XD

To start, I recommend using the Python virtual environments to encapsulate the project and not mix the libraries [venv](https://docs.python.org/es/3.8/library/venv.html), creating an environment virtual is done as follows
> Note: Yo estoy utilizando linux - Ubuntu20.04

```bash
How use it -> python3 -m venv <name>
Python3 -m venv env    
```
to active it:
```bash
source env/bin/activate    
```
having created the virtual environment, now you have to install all the dependencies in the file called requirements.txt for this run the following command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   
```

To finish run the file named main.py and have fun
